# Web-Development-Portfolio
Week 2 Challenge

In this challenge, I was given the task of creating a personal portfolio webpage. This page includes:

- an "about me" section which tells users a little bit about myself 

- a "my work" section which showcases coding projects I've worked on throughout my career, which images of the code and links to the deployed applications

- a "contact me" section which lists how to contact me. 


Some of the features of this page include:

 - HTML structuring and CSS styling

 - accessibility

 - responsiveness

 - UI auto-scrolling when clicking on navigation links

 - images of applications with a link to the deployed application

Live application: https://yaserhdev.github.io/Web-Development-Portfolio/
