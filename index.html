    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Raja Yaser Hussain, but I go by Yaser. I am a recent graduate of Concordia University St. Paul where I earned a bachelors degree in Kinesiology.
       Before I finished, I had already decided that I was going to make a switch to IT, specifically coding. This turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.
       For starters, I have always been proficient with computers, even when I was younger. I used to build computers with my dad, who is a senior software engineer, when I was 10 years old.
       I am extremely tech savvy, yet why I took so long to pursue the career field that was meant for me still puzzles me. Currently I am enrolled in George Washington University's coding bootcamp.
       The main focus of this bootcamp is web development and takes place over the course of 6 months. I can honestly say I didn't expect to have as much fun as am learning and practicing coding.
       It is my hope that after successfully completing this bootcamp, I will be able to build a lucrative IT career for myself.</p>
